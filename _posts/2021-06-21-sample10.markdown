I co-authored this article that provides extensive insight into working remotely in Cape Town, South Africa. I wrote half of the <a href="https://www.worldfootprints.com/shaping-the-rainbow-nation-the-role-of-indians-in-south-africa/" target="_blank">***article***</a> for *Digital Nomad World*, and it was published on June 1st, 2021.
