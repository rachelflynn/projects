I wrote this article commemorating Indians that travelled to South Africa in the 1800s, and the role they played in South African history. I pitched this article to *World Footprints*, and they accepted my submission. They published the article on June 19th, 2021, and it was a featured article on the <a href="https://www.worldfootprints.com/shaping-the-rainbow-nation-the-role-of-indians-in-south-africa/" target="_blank">***website.***</a>
