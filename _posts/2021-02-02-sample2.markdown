I developed the monthly Central College Sustainability Office newsletter using InDesign to share important information with students, staff, and community members. The newsletters were sent via email, so I learned how to embed each issue in an email. I worked with the Central College Sustainability Office as a Communications Assistant from January - May 2017. You can view the newsletter *<a href="documentsfolder1/April Sustainability Newsletter.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>*
