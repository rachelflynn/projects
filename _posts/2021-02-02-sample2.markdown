During my undergrad, I served as the Communications Assistant in the Central College Sustainability Office. I created a newsletter template on InDesign that the office used each month to share important information with students, staff, and community members. We sent the newsletters via email, so I also learned how to embed each issue in an email. You can view the April newsletter that I created *<a href="documentsfolder1/April Sustainability Newsletter.pdf" target="_blank">***here.***</a>*
