While completing my MA at the University of Cape Town, I took a *Media, Development, and Globalisation* course. Our final project involved creating a COVID-19 educational health campaign targeting a vulnerable population group in South Africa. I chose to target students living on-campus at the University of Cape Town since they live in close quarters and can't properly social distance. I developed a campaign with numerous tactics (photobooth, WhatsApp alerts, masks, and posters) and measures to evaluate the success of the campaign. I presented the campaign to my class, and my professor recommended that I submit the campaign to the university's marketing department to implement it on-campus once the students returned to school. You can see the campaign proposal presentation *<a href="documentsfolder1/Just Do It, UCT.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>*
