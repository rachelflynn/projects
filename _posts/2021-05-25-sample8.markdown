While serving as the Marketing Intern at World Relief Chicago, I used Canva to create this refugee arrival graphic. We wanted to educate followers about how many refugees arrived every two weeks and where they came from. Once I updated the numbers, we shared the graphic on the organization's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages. The graphic continued to serve the organization after my internship ended and became a vital part of WRC's social media strategy. I worked with World Relief Chicago as a Marketing Intern from January - May 2018. You can view the graphic *<a href="documentsfolder1/World Relief Chicago 1.png" target="_blank">here.</a>*
