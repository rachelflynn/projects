While completing my BA at Central College, I took a *Communication Research and Writing* course to fulfill my degree requirements. Our primary task involved drafting a literature review and creating a research proposal about our chosen topic. I examined race in mass media and recevied a nearly perfect score. Based on my completed project, my professor selected me as the Communication Studies Writing Fellow for underclassmen taking the same course the following year.
