I wrote this blog post while interning at World Relief Chicago on the organization's WordPress site. During my four months with WRC, my role included managing the blog and occasionally writing posts. _The Black Panther_ was just released, and I was so excited to relate the message of the movie to immigration in the United States and World Relief Chicago's work. I worked with World Relief Chicago as a Marketing Intern from January - May 2018.
