While completing my BA at Central College, I took a *Writing for a Non-Profit* course to improve my writing skills. Part of our assignment involved volunteering at a local non-profit organization and completing their writing projects. I worked with Many Hands for Haiti, an organization that runs a variety of programs in Haiti. I created this brochure on InDesign to raise awareness about the organization's education program, and I followed all of their branding guidelines. You can view the brochure *<a href="documentsfolder1/45ad04_134fb8b991e7471db611a5c2c9a8fc17.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>*
