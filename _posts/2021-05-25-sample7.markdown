I developed this infographic on Canva while interning at World Relief Chicago. It was used to provide basic facts about immigrants in the Chicago area during a social media education campaign. We continuosuly updated the numbers and used it multiple times on Facebook. I worked with World Relief Chicago as a Marketing Intern from January - May 2018.
