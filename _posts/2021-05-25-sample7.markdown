While interning at World Relief Chicago, we ran multiple informational social media campaigns with the goals of educating our followers about immigrants in the Chicago area and creating support for immigrants. I created this infographic on Canva to use in one of these campaigns with the goal of demonstrating the financial contribution of immigrants. I followed the organization's branding guidelines regarding colors and fonts, so they continued to edit and adapt the infographic to new campaign needs, even after my internship ended. I worked with World Relief Chicago as a Marketing Intern from January - May 2018. You can view the infographic *<a href="documentsfolder1/Infographic.png" target="_blank">here.</a>*
