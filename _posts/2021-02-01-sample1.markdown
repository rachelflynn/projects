I served as a Content Writer and Proofreader during the summer of 2018 at the Write Place in Pella, Iowa. In this role, I managed a small portfolio of clients and wrote content for their websites and marketing collateral. I wrote this article for one of our clients, and the company published it on their corporate website. You can *<a href="documentsfolder1/PEC Article.pdf" target="_blank">view the article</a>* or see the published version on the company
